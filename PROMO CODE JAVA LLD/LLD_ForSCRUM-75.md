## Jira Story Details (SCRUM-75)

**Summary:** LLD For Story 5-6

**Description:**

### Story 5: Search and Filter Milestones
**Summary:** As a project manager, I want to search and filter milestones, so that I can quickly find relevant milestones across projects or groups.

**Description:**
The user should be able to search for milestones using various criteria such as title, description, state, and date range. They should also be able to filter milestones by project, group, or personal milestones.

**Technical Context:**
- System: GitLab application server
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Search: Elasticsearch (if integrated)
- API: RESTful and GraphQL

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can search milestones by title, description, and other attributes
- User can filter milestones by state (active/closed)
- User can filter milestones by date range
- User can filter milestones by project, group, or personal milestones
- Search results are paginated and sortable

**Validations:**
- Validate search input to prevent SQL injection
- Ensure user has permissions to view the milestones in search results

**Business Logic:**
- Implement smart search algorithm to provide relevant results
- Cache frequent searches to improve performance

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Search results should be returned within 3 seconds for complex queries
- The system should handle high volumes of concurrent search requests

### Story 6: Milestone Analytics
**Summary:** As a project leader, I want to view analytics for milestones, so that I can gain insights into project performance and team productivity.

**Description:**
The user should be able to access a dashboard showing various analytics related to milestones, such as completion rate, average time to completion, and comparison between estimated and actual completion times.

**Technical Context:**
- System: GitLab application server
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Analytics: Custom analytics engine or integration with tools like Grafana
- Frontend: Interactive charts and graphs (e.g., using D3.js)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can view a dashboard with key milestone metrics
- Dashboard includes visualizations for completion rate, time to completion, and accuracy of estimates
- User can filter analytics by date range, project, or group
- Data can be exported for further analysis

**Validations:**
- Ensure data accuracy by cross-checking with raw database values
- Validate user permissions for accessing analytics data

**Business Logic:**
- Calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) based on milestone data
- Implement trend analysis to show improvement or decline over time

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Analytics dashboard should load within 5 seconds
- The system should handle data aggregation for large projects efficiently
- Implement caching mechanisms to reduce database load for frequently accessed analytics

**Status:** To Do
